* Multiple dropbox instaces - dockerized
  .. what the title says :)
  
  The puprose of this is to have multiple dropbox instances in your machine. For me it started when I wanted to have both my personal & my work dropbox account in the same machine.
  
** Usage
   TODO: improve
   
   1. run the =bootstrap.sh= script
   2. run =docker-compose logs=
	  there check for lines like 
	  ~Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/cli_link_nonce?nonce=xyz~. Go there and put your credentials to link :)
	  
* Future work
  
** Easier login/association
   Wrap the dropoxd (which is  ran by the =entrypoint.sh=) around another process (node?), and looks for  =please visit htpp...= lines in the logs, and will create an html file that will get you to that url
   
** Sync status
   Is there a way to monitor the sync status? as well this could be wrapped around another process (node?) and write to a sync.log file (which can then be =tail=ed)
   
* Technical details
  + docker image from =debian:stretch=
	
** Getting the dropbox tar
   + wget https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64 -O dropbox.tar.gz
	 
   This can/should be done inside the dockerfile.. but would download 2 times, 1 per instance.. hmm..
